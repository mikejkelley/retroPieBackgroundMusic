Play music when you fire up RetroPie!

Why not make your countercade double as a jukebox that plays awesome 80's new wave songs, completing the arcade experience? It's (relatively) easy (now that you have this guide; I spent a day going down a GitHub tutorial rabbit hole and was ultimately unsuccessful and had to resort to parlaying with ChatGPT for several more days and creating my own scripts and so here we are now).

```Play Music
sudo apt-get install mpg123
sudo mkdir scripts
cd scripts
sudo nano play_music.sh```
